Remember, there are real people who poured their heart and soul into this game.

Look guys. Anthem is in a bad place right now but remember to be civil towards the devs. They are people too and probably under a bit of stress right now. Voice your feedback but be considerate and most of all remember there is an actual living person on the other side of it.

BioWare Pls don't give up on Anthem

Share your support & thanks to Hello Games, a company that could have just given up, but instead they just keep giving

Today was my first time playing NMS since I refunded it in August 2016, and I'd like to sincerely congratulate HelloGames for proving me and countless others wrong. Thanks for continuing to chase your incredible vision, and happy travels to you all. Fly safe!

I am a day 1 player of NMS, and I wanted to show my love for the game, developers and the community by making a piece of art for NEXT. I hope you enjoy!

I gotta give it up to u/Valseek for being around when the Crap hits the fan.

Anyone else think this game is dope and doesn’t deserve all the hate? I mean obviously things need to be fixed but by no means is this game ruined.

Seeing a lot of posts about players coming back to the game and now loving it. Raise your hand if you never left because you've always loved the game!

I'm really surprised that nobody has really said it yet. THANKS FOR LISTENING TO US!

Argue with me all you want, but Bethesda is actually trying and I can’t thank them enough.
